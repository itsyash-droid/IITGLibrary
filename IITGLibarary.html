        <h2>What is this page?</h2>
        <p>This website is designed by and for the IITG BS DSAI students. Our aim is to create a unified space where students can easily share and access lecture notes, PDFs, lab solutions, and any other academic material. In the Resource Tab, we also provide the best external resources for further learning, such as roadmaps for tech skills like frontend, backend, AI, and data science development. The Blogs Page is a place for personal expression, where you can inspire your fellow students with your learning journey, experiences from IITG fests, internships, or just day-to-day life at college. The IITG Timeline helps you stay organized with all event schedules and deadlines. Finally, Communities allows you to engage in discussions with others who share your interests, whether in chess, coding, physics, or any other area of expertise.</p>
